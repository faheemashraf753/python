# Variables : variables are used to store data values.
# identifiers : An identifier is the name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other object.
# Variable names can contain letters, digits, and underscores, but they cannot start with a digit.
# Variable names are case-sensitive, which means that 'myVariable' and 'myvariable' are considered different variables.
# Variable names cannot be the same as Python keywords (reserved words).


a = 5     #a is a variable and 5 is the value assigned to it or identifier.
