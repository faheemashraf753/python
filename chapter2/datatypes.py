# datatypes : Datatypes are used to store different types of data in variables.
# Python has several built-in data types, including:
# int : Integer data type is used to store whole numbers (both positive and negative) without decimal points.
# float : Float data type is used to store numbers with decimal points (both positive and negative
# str : String data type is used to store sequences of characters, such as words or sentences. Strings are enclosed in single or double quotes.
# bool : Boolean data type is used to store one of two values: True or False.
#none : None data type is used to represent the absence of a value or a null value.


a = 5           #int
b = 3.14        #float
c = "Hello"     #str
d = True        #bool
e = None       #none
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))
print(type(e))
# You can also use the type() function to check the data type of a variable.
