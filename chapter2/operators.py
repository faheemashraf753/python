# operators : operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands (values or variables) and return a result.
# Python supports several types of operators, including:
# Arithmetic operators : These operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and floor division.
# Assignment operators : These operators are used to assign values to variables. They include the basic assignment operator (=) as well as compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, etc.).
# Comparison operators : These operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (True or False). They include operators such as equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).
# Logical operators : These operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions and return a boolean result.

#note: e.g; 7 + 3 = 10 (7 and 3 are operands, + is operator and 10 is result)   

# arithmetic operators : (+, -, *, /, %, **, //)
a = 10
b = 3
print("Arithmetic Operators:")
print("Addition:", a + b)          # Addition
print("Subtraction:", a - b)       # Subtraction
print("Multiplication:", a * b)    # Multiplication
print("Division:", a / b)          # Division
print("Modulus:", a % b)           # Modulus
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)   # Exponentiation
print("Floor Division:", a // b)   # Floor Division

# assignment operators : (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=)
